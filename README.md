I'm not sure why I even made this but I did and I forgot to make the py file open-source and now its lost so don't except anything to be good lol

# PyMail
The new app for sending E-Mails! Why is it called PyMail? Because it is made in **Python**!

# Important notice

We would like to tell everyone that only hotmail.com and outlook.com are supported and more will be added soon!
**This app only supports Windows for now**
